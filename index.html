    oh the sun's coming down
    and we're speeding
    to catch a sunset
    it's leading
    and i am and you are
    Our awkward waltz
 
    oh the moon also rises
    and we're recycling
    oxygen underneath the black velvet
    the Beatles serenading
    the blizzard of space degenerating
    our awkward waltz

    I must have lived before
    or been free once
    because nothing fills me more
    with shattering nostalgia than the night sky
    and the scenic views as we drive
    past fenced off stretches of land,
    sunflowers and bluebonnets lighting the way
    to somewhere we don't know but we would like to believe we do,
    and the graves that are sprinkled along the way
    to the cities speak volumes of their wanting to be known
    in life so silent, they now scream in their graves
    as the brilliant sun warms them with it's bright golden drops
    reminding us that it's only once we're in the city
    that we miss the drive
    and the quiet star filled skies at night
    with those that will always mean
    the most.

    Let me peel off the stars too
    Lead you into bare blue cubes
    Leave you clipping of Newark's News
    Feeling that New York Blues
    Dealing with all the pretty boos
    Loaning out your lovely hues
     
    'Cause you no longer paint
    You don't sculpt
    Don't compose
    Play, create
     
    I wonder what happened to you.
    My irises are more Au than your Cu.
